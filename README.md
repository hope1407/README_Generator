## Description <a name="description"></a>
This is a Node.js application that dynamically creates Readme files upon a user's input to prompts. It allows the user to list the title of the project, the desired license, installation requirements, contribution parameters, and any current testing that is being implented.  Finally, the Readme file will list the user's contact information and GitHub URL.

## Installation Instructions <a name="install"></a>
Before running the program, confirm that you have installed the 'inquirer' package.  This is done using the 'npm i inquirer' command in the Terminal.  The other two packages (fs and util) are built in.

## Usage Information <a name="usage"></a>
Anyone who gains access to this code is welcome to use it.  Upon cloning the repository, open up your Terminal or GitBash, and, while in the correct folder, type "node index.js".  This will launch the program with the first prompt.

## Contribution Guidelines <a name="contribution"></a>
There are not any contribution guidelines at the moment.  If anyone would like to contribute, feel free to fork or to contact me to branch.

## Test Instructions <a name="test"></a>
We do not have any testing guidelines right now for the README Generator.  If you would like to test it, go right ahead!
